//	Data structures for simulating the execution of user programs
//	running on top of Nachos.
//
//	User programs are loaded into "mainMemory"; to Nachos,
//	this looks just like an array of bytes.  Of course, the Nachos
//	kernel is in memory too -- but as in most machines these days,
//	the kernel is loaded into a separate memory region from user
//	programs, and accesses to kernel memory are not translated or paged.
//
//	In Nachos, user programs are executed one instruction at a time,
//	by the simulator.  Each memory reference is translated, checked
//	for errors, etc.
//
//  DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation

// The following class defines the simulated host workstation hardware, as
// seen by user programs -- the CPU registers, main memory, etc.
// User programs shouldn't be able to tell that they are running on our
// simulator or on the real hardware, except
//	we don't support floating point instructions
//	the system call interface to Nachos is not the same as UNIX
//	  (10 system calls in Nachos vs. 200 in UNIX!)
// If we were to implement more of the UNIX system calls, we ought to be
// able to run Nachos on top of Nachos!
//
// The procedures in this class are defined in machine.cc, mipssim.cc, and
// translate.cc.

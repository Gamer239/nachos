System calls
Create( char* name );
-This system call creates a new file if it doesnt exist.
-Returns nothing whether or not the file is created.

OpenFileId Open( char* filename )
-This system call attempts to open the file.
If it opens the file then it maps the OpenFileId to
the internal pointer.
-Returns a positive integer on success and -1 if the file did not
exist

Write( char* buffer, int size, OpenFileId id )
-This system call attempts to write up to size bytes from the
buffer to the id. This system call will check to see if the id is
valid and then write one byte at a time to the id and check to see if
each write passed or failed.
 -Returns nothing.

 Read( char* buffer, int size, OpenFileId id )
 -This system call attempts to read up to size bytes from the
 id and write them into the buffer. This system call will check to see
 if the id is valid and then write one byte at a time to the buffer
 and check to see if each read passed or failed.
 -Returns nothing.

 Close( OpenFileId id )
 -This system call attempts to close the id if it is currently open
 for the currently running program. If the id is not valid
 then the close call is ignorned.
 -Returns nothing.

 Exit( int status )
 - Exits the current running process, first checking if a parent process
 exists and is waiting on the current process. If a parent is waiting, 
 the parent is released, and the return value of this process is stored
 where the parent process can access it.
 -Returns nothing

 Exec( char* name )
 - Starts a new process running the code in the filename 'name'. A new
 thread and address space are created, and the thread is forked. Housekeeping
 of process ids, children, and parents is also done.
 -Returns spaceid (pid) of the spawned process.

 Join( SpaceId id )
 - If the process with the SpaceId 'id' is a child of the process who calls
 join, the process will wait until the child process finishes. If the child
 process finishes before Join was called, the return value of the child is
 retreived and returned.
 - Returns the return value of the joined process


 Exceptions
 - Only exception that is handled extensively is SyscallException, in which
 each type is handled by a specific syscall method. Otherwise, all other
 exceptions print a warning to standard out and exit the currently running
 process. OverflowException only prints a warning, and does not exit the
 program.

 Scheduling Algorithms
 - No changes to the scheduling algorithm have been made from the previous
 program, this means a priority based algorithm, with round-robin preemption
 is implemented. After a set number of ticks, the scheduler will yield the
 current running process and re-insert it into the queue, based on it priority. 

 SynchConsole
 SynchConsole( char* readFile, char* writeFile )
 -This function initializes the console which in the background
 opens up the machine's console. It then creates its own semaphores
 to handle waiting. If readFile and WriteFile are NULL then they
 get set as ConsoleInput and ConsoleOutput
 -Returns nothing.

 ~SynchConsole
 -This function destroys the SynchConsole
 -Returns nothing.

 ConsoleReadPoll( int c )
 -This function is called by the parent when there is a char available
 -Returns nothing

 ConsoleWriteDone( int c )
 -This function is called by the parent when the write finishes
 -Return nothing.

 CheckCharAvailDone( )
 -This function releases a waiting "get" call.
 Returns nothing.

 WriteDoneDone( )
 -This function releases a waiting "put" call.
 Returns nothing.

 GetChar( )
 -This function asks the console for a character and then locks
 itself until a char the interrupt of a char being available
 releases it.
 -Returns a char if one was found or EOF if it was the end of the file

 PutChar( )
 -This function puts a char into the console and then locks
 itself until the write is complete and it gets released
 by the interrupt calling the WriteDoneDone function.
 -Returns nothing.

 Tests
 - test/retadd: spawns 5 child processes each with a different return value in
 the range 1-5, joins them, then prints the sum of their return values. Should print
 and return 15.
 - test/halt: altered to test Exit() and start testing for args
 - test/shell: modified shell to be more robust. Will quit when it receives "exit",
 otherwise, allows the spawning of child processes by simply typing the filename
 into the prompt.
 - test/create: tests creation of file
